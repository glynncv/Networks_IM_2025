Hi <n> is server-related alert. I understand this is a Zscaler server, but we are not supporting server-level. zscaler team confirmed the server is running fine.

As this alert is DOWN and observing IP not reachable, the server team need to check where the IP is assigned in the server. 

@SD Team, please assign to the concerned team for validation and let us know if any network support.

Hi Ajay

We’ve still not had any response from the Network Teams.  As  you can see from the attached email , Mark Winterbourne is now reporting he has the same issues as Paul Buckley.

Also, please be aware the INC7463774 is still assigned to me in the EUS Team space, aging and on hold while I wait for opinions of Network experts and for clarification on the domain migration status of the license server, etc. 

Concerned as I’d expect this ticket to be on Colman’s radar by now because of its age.

I’m on vacation tomorrow until after the Spring Bank Holiday, so I’ll not be around to chase. I’ve cc’d Michael Cox (UKGIL EUS resident tech) and David Cox (my LTIM cover tech), in case you or network teams need additional tests/info.

Thank you

Subject: Latest licence issues

Hi <n> we've been having a problem with the licence intermittently dropping out, then coming back a few minutes later, then dropping again, etc. 
When doing Excel batch runs, we often don't get told the licence is dropping but we get failed runs or just halting and not progressing. 

We've all tried pinging the licence server, (in miami?) at various times/days and get anything from 1%-12% lost packets out of 100. Pinging servers in other locations always give 0% so it doesn't seem to be a Stonehouse problem. Pinging the AMESim licence server from other sites also give the dropped packets, which suggests it's the site where the server is located that has he problem. 
Have you noticed anything similar? The command we used in the commend window is ""ping -n 100 USMIAUBP-AP01.phinia.local"".

Just a follow up, Paul is still reporting issues with dropped license connections to the Auburn Hills Amesim license server USMIAUBP-AP01.  

Here’s the Tracert from today

 a

Locally we still think the issue is a result of Gillingham not having gone through the latest PHINIA SD-WAN migration where Auburn Hills has but no official confirmation on this theory. 

Also Paul is pointing to the Amesim license using the USMIAUBP-AP01.Phinia.local [10.34.61.21] but because the server also pings on the delphidrive.com domain with the same IP, its believed the server has yet to migration from delphidrive.com domain to phinia.local. Again we have not had anything confirming this status. The comment to have Paul (user) to raise an RITM to remove the delphidrive.com instance is probably inappropriate as this should be through internal IT processes and still we need confirmation of the server domain status.

Are we able to confirm these issues are likely to be due to Gillingham having not migrated as part of the  SD-WAN project?  Who can confirm the domain status of the USMIAUBP-AP01  is it still on the delphidrive.com domain or has it definitely migrated?

checking with Paul to ensure he still has the issues....
murray, michelle 
Hi Paul, I'm about to chase the SIAM and network teams on your issues with dropped connections to Amesim licenses on  USMIAUBP-AP01.Phinia.local, assume you are still facing the issues, nothing changed  in behavior?

<n> point taken and not for Paul to manage this but IT Services. I'll again discuss with SDIM to try to get confirmation if Auburn Hills has had their WAN migrated or not and also if the server has actually migrated from Delphidrive.com or not before having removing any references from domains

2025-05-06 04:05:06 - <n> (Work notes)

it responds with both FQDN USMIAUBP-AP01.DelphiDrive.com and USMIAUBP-AP01.phinia.local
Other known activities in April...Also Zscaler VPN rolled out but this should be off when onsite - so discounting it. The other significant activity globally, is a WAN connectivity migration for AT&T to BT service provider. Gillingham has not cut over as yet due to issues faced with other sites, especially Blois who rolled back.  I will find out if Auburn Hills has migrated their WAN connections as the site that hosts the server i
 I'll investigate more

specifically, someone changed the Environment Variable from one to the other and that seems to be both silent and transparent

and keep monitoring the ping -t I have going to see if there are worst patches through the day

I was wondering that but Zscaler was actually mid March ?? TeamCentre was early April.
 but I'm not saying it's Teamcentre

to be fair seems pretty stable from my PC. Initial ping had a few request timeouts but not that many to suggest issues. Not seen any with the ping to IP
 <n> (Gillingham) 08:42
it seems to have good and bad periods
 murray, michelle 08:42
could depend on network or server load/usage levels.
 from your experience is it worse in the afternoons or completely random throughout the day
 <n> (Gillingham) 08:44
many are overnight (so I don't know time)
 a few at mid-day
 the screengrab with 7/8 lost was 16:16
 murray, michelle 08:45
ummm.... I'll check if there are server maintenance windows coinciding with overnight - may be a time they patch servers causing more response outages
 <n> (Gillingham) 08:47
and that is another thing - during those few weeks, I was running simulations pretty much full time
 but as a frequent user of Amesim, something got worse during April compared to normal experience
 also (and the reason I complained) there is no recording on any of the INC
 problems before and after ""Christian put something on your pc on 12 April""
 problems before and after change of server name from delphidrive to phinia.local

On site. My opinion is that it is connection at the other end.

thanks I'll do a constant ping to the server and see if I get the same results as your shared ping test
 Do you have local colleagues who use Fusion pointing to the same license server?

Abdul should be using everything the same as me but is not suffering the same problem.

you are on site now - correct?
  <n> (Gillingham) 08:24
I am on site now but was not running that software over the weekend
  murray, michelle 08:28
no worries but can you for another ping test for me          ping usmiaubp-ap01.phinia.local -t              (the -t is a continuous ping). I have one running as from my desktop. I'm seeing a lot so successes with the odd timeout.  I want to compare from your network connection
 If Abdul is not seeing an issue from site, suggests not server side issue. Unless he is mainly using from home

Hi Paul,

As we discussed and checked observing packet drops from your system( server IP) (5%) and the same verified from the core switch with a different location, we observed a success rate 99%.

1. As observed, USMIAUBP-AP01 is available on both domains and it is not yet migrated to Phinia, we need to remove the DNS entry from Phinia.local domain. (RITM need to raise by paul)
2. As traffic travels UK to USA, packet drop is normal at the core switch.
3. USMIAUBP-AP01 - confirm the location, will check connectivity locally.
4. Test from 10304 & 274 site.
5. As you are getting more packet drops from your system, post DNS entry remove, will validate again.
6. Will inform to Local it for support also.

2025-05-19 05:14:15 - Sasmal, Ashish (Additional comments)
Dear Michelle,

The domain migration checking is in process and will assgin the concerned team soon and post validation, if any network support or any support is required, will provide accordingly.

Just a follow up, Paul is still reporting issues with dropped license connections to the Auburn Hills Amesim license server USMIAUBP-AP01.  

Here's the Tracert from today

 a

Locally we still think the issue is a result of Gillingham not having gone through the latest PHINIA SD-WAN migration where Auburn Hills has but no official confirmation on this theory. 

Also Paul is pointing to the Amesim license using the USMIAUBP-AP01.Phinia.local [10.34.61.21] but because the server also pings on the delphidrive.com domain with the same IP, its believed the server has yet to migration from delphidrive.com domain to phinia.local. Again we have not had anything confirming this status. The comment to have Paul (user) to raise an RITM to remove the delphidrive.com instance is probably inappropriate as this should be through internal IT processes and still we need confirmation of the server domain status.

Are we able to confirm these issues are likely to be due to Gillingham having not migrated as part of the  SD-WAN project?  Who can confirm the domain status of the USMIAUBP-AP01  is it still on the delphidrive.com domain or has it definitely migrated?

Hi SIAM

FYI, Gillingham has not migrated to the new PHINIA WAN infrastructure (SD-WAN. Keith Reed PM),  and believe this impacts Gillingham devices/users network connectivity or performance to other remote/global devices, especially if target locations have completed the WAN migration.   

Due to Damon's contacts being OOO currently, I have tried and failed to gather info about the WAN migration status of the Auburn Hills site which hosts the Amesim licensing server Paul is using - USMIAUBP-AP01. Also to understand if the USMIAUBP-AP01.Phinia.local [10.34.61.21] server has actually migrated to the phinia.local domain or still delphidrive.com domain – it responds to ping tests on each domain.  

At the end of the day this looks to be a network \ WAN  issue which is not in EUS scope. Especially taking into account the results of the constant ping test shared by Paul this morning…..

 

Would you be able to assign and engage the Network Teams?
Kind Regards

I've asked SDIM - Damon Proyer about the Auburn Hills WAN migration status and also to confirm if the server has definitely completed a domain migration or not  - waiting for feedback from Damon

2025-04-28 03:13:00 - Buckley, Paul (Additional comments)
My opinion is that it is connection the other end. Ping time varies between 150 ms to ""lost packet"" whereas another server is always 8 ms and Blois cluster is always 17 ms

Hi Xavier
 
This is Ruhika from Global service desk
 
This is Regarding INC7432138 -Clearcase is very slow,
 
Hi Ruhika
 
Is the issue still persist?
 
yes issue still present
 
Since when are you facing this issue?
 
last Friday, the use of Clearcase was difficult
 
I can say from last friday
 
Is there any error message? If so, please share the screenshot.
 
But this morning, it takes a lot's of time to connect, worst than last friday
 
I click on log folder and see that : (cursor not visible on screenshot, but he waits for network answer )
 
 
and 2 minutes later :

Hello Pallavi,

The URL is working fine when we disable the ZPA, 2. I believe it should be accessible from ZIA.
Please schedule a call to help configure the bypass application segment on ZPA, as there are several options to choose from.

 ⚠  *EXTERNAL SENDER* 

Nikhil,

I missed the initial logs attached on the case. Also, ZCC logs were requested proactively to confirm that traffic was redirected to ZPA in case the transaction is not present in diagnostic logs.

It's not required now, as the logs are showing up in ZPA. Below is my finding:

1. There's no successful log in last 14 days for application ""sapph1.phinia.com"" which means it has never worked.

 

2. All the 48 error messages are related to ""Connection request to server timed out"".

 

Below is the error description:
 


3. Currently the traffic is hitting the wildacrd application segment and is redirected to Amsterdam app connector.

 

4. The FQDN is showing up in ZIA logs and there are successful logs:

 

5. I am able to access it via ZIA and receiving authentication prompt:

 



Next Action Plan:
1. Please check if the application should be accessible from ZIA/ ZPA.
2. If it should be accessible from ZIA, then configure bypass application segment on ZPA.
https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuring-defined-application-segments#:~:text=ZPA%20Admin%20Portal.-,Always%3A,-If%20selected%2C%20users
3. If not, then kindly check if it's reachable from Amsterdam app connector.

Also, my working hours are 08:00 AM to 05:00 PM EST. So, I will not be available at 3:00 PM IST tomorrow.

Let me know if you would like to have call at 03:00 and I will handover the case.

Hi Saraswathi 
 
Thanks for checking this.  When we try to connect to UKGILP-DB06 using
• 10.142.23.50
• UKGILP-DB06
• UKGILP-DB06.DELPHIDRIVE.COM
 
We get the error ""The target principal name is incorrect.  Cannot generate SSPI context.""
 
If we use UKGILP-DB06.PHINIA.LOCAL, we get connected but it's slow.

Thanks Sindhu and Rayappa for taking a look at the servers.

Is there anything network related that could cause this?

Would migrating the servers from the DELPHIDRIVE domain to the PHINIA domain help?

Hello

Not sure what you want me to do, user cannot access shared drives while working from home. They are connected with Zscaler and should be able to open network shared drives as if they were in the office.
I have gone over every thin I can think of and it all comes back to permissions are not correct.

⚠ *EXTERNAL SENDER*
Hello <n> you for your time over the phone .

As we discussed, we still need to collect the debug logs from the WLC while the issue is occurring. Please follow the steps below to gather the required information:

1. Access the WLC CLI via SSH or console.
2. Run the following commands using the affected client’s MAC address: “while the issue is happening ”

File 1 :

#config paging disable
#Debug client <client mac address>

File 2 :

#config paging disable
#Show client detail <client mac address> [ try to collect this command multiple times while above debug command running]

Also, can you please confirm what is the SSID name.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Have a great day.

There was issue with WAP163 which we have fixed.

This is under monitoring. user is able to connect wifi now and will report if any issue today.

Forget what i say, It seems that this solution lasted almost an hour, it reverted to the old problem.

2025-07-08 01:14:52 - Ionita, Marian (Additional comments)
Disconect from WiFi, after that Right click on your WiFi and Forget. 
After that, change your log in laptop password => restart laptop => log in on your WiFi network with new password

We checked on the destination azure VM as suggested, there is no nsg rule that we found which blocks the connectivity, however we will setup a working session with wintel team and network to troubleshoot where the incoming connectivity is blocked.
Please note that from destination azure server azrnawpolmap002 we are able to reach the source VM FRBLOP-AP22

Hi Team, the main issue is here some users can't reach http://trucksapp.phinia.local/ but some users can. I suspected VPN so asked for Zscaler installation. 
Later I tried to open the webpage with and without ZScaler and I was able to access both ways. Could you please push the app and route this ticket to concerned team with website accesibility? Thank you.

USER'S ISSUE (Detailed issue description): Cant access azureuw-db011.delphidrive.com with PHINIA account but I can with Delphi
> I have another laptop up until 1 month ago and everything was smooth while trying to access azureuw-db011.delphidrive.com, more exactly azureuw-db011.delphidrive.com/reports/powerbi/PCL/SOTD_Report_Excel. Since I changed my laptop, something happened, and I cannot access it anymore. DXC helped with a previous ticket I had to enable Zscaler on my machine. I reached out to Analytics team, and they were able to confirm the path is still valid and for them it works fine. 

After many discussions, one scenario we ran was to give me access directly to the server and access from there. If I login into the server with PHINIA account, it doesn't work. If I login on the server with Delphi account (vzcv29) it works fine.

I assume some changes were done trying to enable Zscaler on my machine otherwise I don't have a clue what could be it, apart from not being part of a specific IT group with my PHINIA account. 

Thanks!

I am at home connected to VPN via Zscaler. I tried last week from a PHINIA plant, connected to the office network and I had same error. Also tried via mobile hotspot connected with Global Protect and same error

Troubleshooting steps performed: Since the server has both records with Delphidrive.com and Phinia.local Domain. I suspect server with delphidrive.com domain has been migrated to Phinia.local. Then I told user to try to access the server with Phinia.local. After trying with Phinia.local server he is able to access the server with Phinia account.

Hello Cosmin,

    Thanks for your time over team's call.

    As discussed, you are able to access the server azureuw-db011.delphidrive.com earlier but now you can't access with PHINIA account.

   Since the server has both records with Delphidrive.com and Phinia.local Domain. I suspect server with delphidrive.com domain has been migrated to Phinia.local. Then I told to you to try to access the server with Phinia.local now you are able to access the server with Phinia account.

[cid:cb13af22-4514-4d40-b496-629303f72ca9]

Hence, as you confirmed we are proceeding to close the ticket.


Thanks & regards,

Hello Ajith,

Since I was able to send you that email is not a network issue so please don’t reply just to have one less email in inbox. 

If it was a network issue, please help explain how it worked on my former laptop, with exact same setup meaning working from home or office, using Zscaler VPN or Global Protect when outside of office. 
Single thing changed was my machine. 

Other users are still able to access like before, with no issue.

Hello,

I had a discussion today with your colleague Bikramjeet Singh where we also had a call and I shared with him the issue experienced.
I am also adding my colleague Ionut here to this thread as maybe he can explain better from a more technical perspective if needed.

Simply put, while trying to access that link, it doesn’t work using either office connection or home connection+VPN (both Zscaler and Global Protect).
When trying to access via mstsc connection directly to a server, when I login with PHINIA it doesn’t allow me to access, when I login with Delphi credentials on the server then trying to access the link, it works fine. 

Don’t really know what more to tell you.

Hello
 
Multiple users still reporting the same issue.
 
 
Scope of issue beyond just opening models, some users cannot login to teamcenter
 
Most users at Stonehouse site reporting issue and are signed into the Gillingham server on Teamcenter. Furthermore to this, network drive access from Stonehouse to Gillingham showing very very slow speeds, with some drives inaccesible
 
<n> (Stonehouse)
Most users at Stonehouse site reporting issue and are signed into the Gillingham server on Teamcenter. Furthermore to this, network drive access from Stonehouse to Gillingham showing very very slow speeds…
I think due to some network issues 
 
I have had one user report back that they have had a drawing SW file load. Waiting on further confirmation from other users
 
<n>
I think due to some network issues
Yes, this has been fed back by some users. Is this being investigated?
 
Can you please 
 
Contact Network team 
 
Who can I contact please?
 
Reports from users in TC-G stating SWIM is not working
 
And users still unable to login to Teamcenter as well
 
Do multiple reports need to be raised for each issue?
 
Can I assign this incident to
 
Network team?
 
Possibly, I do not know if it is the route problem but might be a start

No definitive solution was identified. The issue has been left to the AD and Network teams, but I have received no update.
The provisional solution for the previous cases was to connect the device to the Phinia_Mobile SSID.

Hi Leontin
As Claudiu mentioned below, short term solution: you need connect the laptop to Phinia_Mobile SSID.
Permanent solution to connect to general wifi needs network team to work on it – this is not blocked from Security side, but is a network topic.

Hi Veronique,

We have this laptop (kiosk) used in shopfloor production to scan(datamatrix) some pieces from production.
The laptop access to the Phinia network via WiFi is necessary, due to its portability in Injectors CV production areas.

Yhank you!

Tested cabling, ports etc. for switch A18 - 282-UK-SWA09-L2 reset meters etc., no IP is being shown. this is connected to port 24 this started Tuesday.

<n> primary pumps triduum outstation is also not producing graphic this started the end of December; this is connected to port 22
Issue with the network or switch","2025-02-05 06:15:47 - <n> (Work notes)
Troubleshooting steps performed:
1. There are few meters, which were not getting IP addresses from temp wired network, other few meters were not getting gateway IP, and the rest of the meters were getting IP address from 192.168.X.X. We were able to trace only few devices, as per user's update, all the devices were directly connected to the switch and IPs were not assigned statically to the devices, DHCP option was enabled on all the meters.
2. As discussed with site's local IT (Cosmin) over Team's call, there is an unmanaged switch connected to the switch - 282-UK-SWA09-L2 on port - Gi1/0/24 from very long and a batch of meters are connected to that switch. Those meters were working fine until Monday (20-01-2025) and later they haven't received valid IP addresses, even DHCP option is enabled.
3. Today we verified and modified the port - Gi1/0/24 configuration from VLAN1 to VLAN350 and shared the MAC addresses which were seen on that port, meters received IP addresses (reachable/pinging).
4. Cosmin tested and updated in chat that the IP addresses are reachable remotely, so we informed him to use those IP addresses which are leasing from VLAN350.
5. He updated that there are another batch of meters having similar issue, so we informed him to check with facility team and share us the switchport details to which those meters are connected. All meters are connecting on unmanageable switch, and we can’t use the unmanageable as per DT guideline.
On Hold Reason (If applicable):NA
Latest Update: We have changed the vlan 1 to vlan 350 on meters connected port all the meters are working fine. There is no response from user, as per the 3 strike rule policy, we are proceeding with closure of the ticket.

Hi Cosmin,

This is to inform you that, all meters are connecting on unmanageable switch, and we can't use the unmanageable as per DT guideline.

So, Please check and confirm for ticket closer if everything is working as expected after changing the vlan 350.

Hello,

Going forward with the issues generated by DHCP I would suggest keeping the meters on VLAN350 and making sure they retain the IP addresses before I further go on setting up the corporate energy monitoring tools.

Network team what do you need from our site in order to complete this task?

As discussed over call, I have reverted port from vlan 350 to vlan 1 but device mac is not learning on the port. So, I requesting to you please check the meters use the DHCP method instant of manually IP configuration.

Once device will get the mac address then, we will do the reservation for the same.

Hello,

The meters need to be on VLAN 1 as initial configuration and retain a static IP address as we are about to configure them to send important data to corporate, and the IP address is something that once initiated and set it will not be able to be changed.

Hi Cosmin,

There is a unmanaged switch which is connected to the switch - 282-UK-SWA09-L2 on port - Gi1/0/24 and a batch of meters are connected to that switch. Unmanaged switch connected ports MAC addresses were not learning during issue, So we had bounced the unmanaged switch connected port(Gi1/0/24) and for testing changed the VLAN configuration from VLAN 1 to VLAN 350, post the changes meters connected to network and working fine. If still facing issues then we need to reboot the unmanaged switch.

Please let us know can we keep Meters in VLAN 350 only or can we change back to VLAN 1.

Hello,

The MAC addresses were supplied previously one by one when the meters were fitted in the first place.
It seems that changes were made on network configuration, changing VLAN, now requesting the MAC addresses again as it is a new config, this needs to be investigated, and root cause provided.

Hi Cosmin,

VLAN1 is dedicated only for production machines (laptops & PCs), but the device type is Meters, so for these meters or any special devices we can use VLAN350. Also, if you want the IP address to be fixed for the meters, please share us the MAC addresses, so that we will verify and do static reservations from our end.


Thanks & Regards,
Vineetha

Hello,

Is it possible to understand why the VLAN config of the port was changed as the previous configuration was set to VLAN1 and was previously working and getting. The hardware will need to retain  the ip address so Static, please confirm if set as required.

@Williams, Christopher (Stonehouse)<mailto:chwilliams@phinia.com> when you have the time please supply LAN Team with the Phase 2 port number and switch name that the other batch of meters are connected to.

Hi Cosmin,

As discussed over Team's call, there is a unmanaged switch connected to the switch - 282-UK-SWA09-L2 on port - Gi1/0/24 from very long and a batch of meters are connected to that switch. Those meters were working fine until Monday and later they haven't received valid IP addresses, even DHCP option is enabled. Today we verified and modified the port - Gi1/0/24 configuration from VLAN1 to VLAN350 and shared you the MAC addresses which were seen on that port, meters received IP addresses (reachable/pinging).

You tested and updated in chat that the IP addresses are reachable remotely, so from now onwards you can use those IP addresses which are leasing from VLAN350. Since there are another batch of meters having similar issue, please check with facility team and share us the switchport details to which those meters are connected, so that we will check from our end.

Troubleshooting steps performed: we could see the devices are not getting IP addresses from temp wired network and some of the devices were not getting gateway IP from your end and some of the devices getting IP address range from 192.168.X.X. So, we had tried to trace the devices from our end, only we are able to trace the below devices from switch end. As per your update, all the devices were directly connected to the switch and no IPs were assigning statically to the devices.

I have just seen Ian and grab the IP information via Phina Wi-Fi
The issue seems to resolve itself by being left running via LAN - Unsure if it corrects itself via a policy update or something similar?
I now feel confident that if another customer has the issue I now know how to resolve it.

USER'S ISSUE (Detailed issue description):
I've lost ability to connect to my remote machine via the computer name: DL5JWH1M2.Phinia.local
But I can connect using an IP: 10.234.176.46
To solve this issue I was told to run the following command on my laptop as well as on the remote machine: ipconfig /flushdns
I was able to run it on my laptop, but on the remote machine I don't have sufficient rights so I need IT to do this for me.

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS (record all steps taken):
User is unable to access Remote Desktop DL5JWH1M2(10.234.176.46)
User is able to connect if they user the IP Address as the Computer name
If the user uses the Computer name DL5JWH1M2 they are getting error message as in the attachement
Ran the command ipconfig /flushdns on Users machine and Remote Desktop

Dear Service Desk, please re-assign to the PHINIA Global Network Services Team as they are responsible for the configuration and rollout of the PHINIA ZScaler VPN and are aware of the IP / hostname  DNS  resolution on Zscaler VPN connections. Thank You

Today 14:49 <n>
Hi Carina, as discussed yesterday, I reached out to my EUS Team leads and have been advised to have your incident re-assigned to the PHINIA Global Network Services team who are responsible for the rollout of the PHINIA Zscaler VPN and apparently they are aware of the IP  to name and vice-versa DNS issues under VPN connections.
 
Unfortunately, until they find a final solution to the ZScaler VPN central configurations there is nothing else I can do from my EUS Team scope.
 
Obviously, you still have a working workaround in using the remote desktop IP to remote connect through while this is being done.
 
Just wanted you know that I'm having to pass your ticket on to another support team.

Confirmed I can successfully remote desktop to DL5JWH1M2 using the hostname over a global protect VPN hotspot connection . So it points to issues on Carina's laptop.

Double checking with Carina that she still cannot connect using the hostname

2025-02-03 10:42:40 - <n> 2 (Work notes)
Carina logged off/disconnected from DL5JWH1M2.phinia.local. I have successfully tested the remote desktop connection to DL5JWH1M2 using the hostname from my onsite/on LAN desktop. Confirmed  the PC IP is 10.234.176.46 at this point. Before trying to refresh the IP / DNS records for the PC, I'm testing if I have the same issues as Carina from a Global Protect VPN connection

same on hold - Carina is not sure on the exact location of DL5JWH1M2 but thinks it is in a lab. I'm assuming electronics lab, so need to hunt down the device to try to resolve the DNS issue. Carina is presenting at the moment so doubt I will be able to get onto DL5JWH1M2 as she'll probably be remote connecting to it

Morning Carina, I have your INC7344627 Remote Desktop -  Remote connection issue.  Please let me know where I can physically find your remote desktop - DL5JWH1M2.Phinia.local, on the Gillingham site and I will make a visit to run the various Ipconfig commands to try to help with what sounds like a network DNS issue.  I will need you logged off and disconnected to do this, so we will need to agree a convenient time for you.
 
Obviously in the meantime you can connect using the desktop's IP address.

Hi Team,

As per update from PHINIA Global Network Team informed that communication is permitted, and it seems the PC hostname is not in the Phinia DNS.

User is unable to access Remote Desktop DL5JWH1M2(10.234.176.46).
User can connect if they use the IP Address as the Computer name.

Phinia network team informed to check with Phinia DNS Team, Request you to please check and assist on the same.

Thanks,

Hi Carina, I've successfully remote connected to DL5JWH1M2 via hostname and IP from my onsite desktop connected to the PHINIA LAN but also from a laptop connected to Global Protect VPN via my mobile hotspot.
 
So these tests point back to your laptop's remote desktop connectivity. I assume you are using the PHINIA Global Protect VPN to get the PHINIA corporate network - correct?

Unfortunately, we have already addressed this issue, as I was the one who responded in the previous discussion. 

Before that, we tried updating the drivers, reinstalling them, running gpupdate /force, ipconfig /flushdns /registerdns /release /renew, and netsh commands and other things, without success. 
However, there is nothing more we can do on our end.

Dear SvD, user suspects that the issue is related to ZScaler because tool is sometimes working. There is an intermittent workability about the tool hence route the ticket to the team concerned with ZScaler.

Please share the problematic system's Host Name and user ID.

Zscaler requested log from the user system.


At this stage of the issue, I believe a troubleshooting session may not be necessary, as the answer to this problem likely lies within the Client Connector logs. To investigate further, please provide me with the following: 
• Screenshots showing that ZIA is both On Trusted Network and Enabled.
• Client Connector logs exported from an affected user. Please ensure that the logs are in Debug mode before exporting.

Hi David,

I understand your query, you want the Zscaler to be deactivated while working from the PHINIA network and it should be enabled on the Public Network. Please let me know if I am wrong.


We will update if any changes are required to the Zscaler (ZCC) behaviour.

1. Access the WLC CLI via SSH or console.
2. Run the following commands using the affected client’s MAC address: “while the issue is happening ”
 
File 1 :
 
#config paging disable
#Debug client <client mac address>
 
File 2 :
 
#config paging disable
#Show client detail <client mac address> [ try to collect this command multiple times while above debug command running]

We have been experiencing Wi-Fi issues at the Blois site for a few months. Some computers are sometimes connected to Wi-Fi but display the message ""Connected without internet.""
We cannot find any solutions; after several hours or a few minutes, the Wi-Fi works normally again. This penalizes users who have meetings at that time and cannot connect via cable.
Please redirect to the LAN Team. Today it was on the BLSLTOFF0066 and the BLSLTOFF0278 pc. I am from local IT and I need your help to understand and fix this. Thanks","2025-03-14 12:19:49 - <n> (Work notes)

Troubleshooting steps performed:
1. One of the user's device (Hostname - BLSLTOFF0066) is facing issues while accessing internet, so I asked user to share the ipconfig/all details (attached the file).
2. From ipconfig/all details, I found that the device received a valid IP address and its reachable.
3. User informed that the local network works but not the internet, he can ping the gateway but after that he can't get out to internet.
4. He also mentioned that the issue is not that he can't connect to Wi-Fi but can't access to internet via the Wi-Fi.
5. So, I asked user to see if the firewall is enabled on that device, he checked and disabled the firewall. Post that he also disconnected the Wi-Fi and connect it again, but still the same issue (unable to access any of the applications which is using internet).
6. Even restarting the device didn't work.
7. For testing I asked user to connect to any other SSID, so he connected to PHINIA-Guest, and it worked.
8. The device is near to WAP241, so we verified the WAP in the controller and could see clients connected to it.
9. I asked user to check if the wireless network adapters are updated or not, he checked and did all the drivers and BIOS updates. But still the pc is connecting to the Wi-Fi but without internet.

May I know is it related to sharepoint?
 
To send a document for approval, the following steps are performed: Automate, request sign off, choose approver, run flow. After pressing the 'request sign off' button, the window does not load in such a way that I can proceed with the next steps of running the flow for the document to be sent for approval. This window remains in continuous loading
 
this is the sharepoint link where documents are loaded : Injectors Plant Process Documentation - Home
 
May i have error screenshot please?
 
 
I will send this ticket to concerned team to check and assist you further.
 
Ok, thank you!

1. When I reached user over chat, he informed that his account was temporarily unlocked.
2. I asked if he have updated the new password in his mobile or not. He mentioned that he did this before. The iPhone doesn't store the passwords in the app it never asks for a password once it's logged into.
3. I then informed him to sign out his account in the mobile and sign in with new/recently changed password. He did and confirmed that it's ok now.

Hi team, 

We got  a big network slowness from a DMZ on Blois site .

DMZ range IP : 
10.254.8.X 255.255.255.192

Attaching some screens capture where trying to ping some servers, so very long response time & loss of packets.

Please network team, check on it as it's really impacting the engine test bench.

Hi Pawel,

Please find the chat discussion summary below,


  1.  You are facing issue with all the applications which is using data from OneDrive or local drive (if you run .stp files from these location you need to wait many time more than PC disk) and load files from OneDrive or local drive is below 1 MB/s, load files from PC drive is more than 1 GB/s.
  2.  You haven’t downloaded large files from your supplier, they send files to OneDrive, not large than 115 MB and downloading is around 600 Kb/s and your teammates in office have 100 Mp/s
[cid:image001.png@01DB9910.4548FFA0]
  3.  We asked if your wireless network adapters are up to date or not, you check and shared us the below screenshot, which implies few updates are required. So you tried to run Dell Support Assist, but it didn’t allow you to manual update.
[cid:image002.png@01DB9911.714C4840]
  4.  You checked and informed that you will download the drivers, install and check again.

[cid:image003.png@01DB9911.DA842A30]

  1.  After you install the PCIe Ethernet Controller, drive was not better, below was speed of copy files to local drive.

[cid:image004.png@01DB9911.DA842A30]

  1.  Later we asked if you were connected to Zscaler/VPN while uploading files to one drive, so you updated that Zscaler was installed to you PC yesterday, but the issue started few week ago before Zscaler was installed and you are not using VPN.
  2.  We asked you to turn off Zscaler and restart the PC. You did, but when you turned on the PC, Zscaler turned on automatically. So you turned off again and the speed on local drive was ok.

[cid:image005.jpg@01DB9912.CACE9980]

  1.  But the still same issue with One drive.
[cid:image006.png@01DB9912.CACE9980]
  2.  You confirmed that after you turn off Zscaler, the local drive transfer is more than 100 MB/s, before was 500 KB/s only. If Zscaler is on transfer to local drive is 355 KB/s.

[cid:image007.png@01DB9913.33CD1BF0]

@IT Service Desk<mailto:phinia@service-now.com> team user is facing issue while uploading/downloading files to One Drive, so please route this ticket to WAN team to verify further.

Troubleshooting steps performed: 
1. I asked if Olivier changed AD password recently and he confirmed that it was changed last month.
2. And asked if the new password is updated on other devices (like mobile) in which he uses his AD account, but he updated that he don't use that account on mobile (doesn't use Outlook or Teams on his smartphone)
3. However when he sign in using his account, he is providing the new/recently changed password only.
4. I then informed him to clear the saved password from the browser.
5. Later I asked him to sign out and sign in, but David noticed that the account was locked in AD and asked us to unlock it. Since, we don't have access to unlock any device from AD end, I reached AD team, they unlocked the account.
6. Post that Olivier logged out his account and logged in again.
7. He haven't seen any issue since then.

Hi David and Olivier,

Please find the chat summary below.


  1.  I asked if Olivier changed AD password recently and he confirmed that it was changed last month.
  2.  And asked if the new password is updated on other devices (like mobile) in which he uses his AD account, but he updated that he don’t use that account on mobile (doesn't use Outlook or Teams on his smartphone)
  3.  However when he sign in using his account, he is providing the new/recently changed password only.
  4.  I then informed him to clear the saved password from the browser.
  5.  Later I asked him to sign out and sign in, but David noticed that the account was locked in AD and asked us to unlock it. Since, we don’t have access to unlock any device from AD end, I reached AD team, they unlocked the account.
  6.  Post that Olivier logged out his account and logged in again.
  7.  He haven’t seen any issue since then.

Hence, we are closing the ticket with your confirmation and as I mentioned please ask users not to save any passwords in the browser.

• The discussions highlighted issues with SD-WAN traffic interception and address translation, impacting server communication. 
• Zscaler Vendor suggested bypassing Zscaler and using MPLS, but Network Team noted MPLS will be phased out soon. 
• Temporary solutions like deploying firewalls and using cron jobs for data transfer were proposed.
• Incident will remain open until an acceptable workaround is confirmed with the Clearcase business team.

Hi there, I have had several calls this week so far from the office and have not experienced any issues with them cutting out/freezing or pausing so mine seems to be ok.

 

Thanks

Hello Lisa and Abby,

As discussed to both you on team's chat, the issue has been happening in office network and both of you are working from home today having no call drops observed. We are suspecting the issue was happening due to the office network/internet so requesting you to please try to replicate the issue in office network and let us know if the issue still persists. If still issue persist we will schedule a call to capture the call health and to troubleshoot further.

reply from: mwinterbourn@phinia.com

I've had a message saying that someone has been waiting 5 days for a response from me and since they hadn't heard they were closing the ticket, but I don't know what the were waiting for. The day before I had posted my latest pings, and they weren't good. If they wanted me to try again THAT DAY they should have asked me to check, rather than just making a statement that they didn't get any problems.

I have posted my latest ping today, which is 5%, the worst in some time. So, the problem remains.

reply from: mwinterbourn@phinia.com

Although the person who closed the ticket managed to get 0% lost packets, my, (and other peoples) connection to the Michigan server still suffers from lost packets and drops the licence, eg just now:
Ping statistics for 10.34.61.21:
Packets: Sent = 100, Received = 98, Lost = 2 (2% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
Minimum = 136ms, Maximum = 702ms, Average = 215ms

Therefore, I don't think the issue has been resolved. It needs to be monitored for a while to check whether or not the connection has indeed improved or if the 0% loss was just a passing respite.

Regards

Mark W

User confirmed for incident closure it is affected due to ongoing SDWAN migration

2025-05-16 09:14:29 - <n> (Work notes)
Hello Team,

As per the findings we see that this location is still not migrated to Zscaler and the issue is occurring post roll back changes of migration to SDWAN setup.

Kindly check if the rollback is not properly working and why the ISP pointing to some other geo-location IPs.

2025-05-12 11:18:16 - <n> (Work notes)
Thank you for your time over the call. Below is the call summary: 
• The user Roman is based out of Poland and whenever he browses some sites, the page is showing UK/US pages. For testing we were checking on iPhone cena website and the process were showing in different current and not Poland current i.e., Polish z?oty
• The public IP was 65.205.150.224 and location was showing as US.
• The IP was not coming to Zscaler from ip.zscaler.com and speedtest.zscaler.com. The traffic was not coming to Zscaler cloud as the Internet security is DISABLED.
• We also tested by logging out Zscaler and the currency was not shown correctly.
 
• The behavior is because of the Public Ip not mapping to the user location. For testing purpose,we shifted to mobile hotspot of the user(still Zscaler disabled), the IP and the pages started to show Poland/poland currency.
• You explained me that in Trusted network there are 2 ways to send the traffic and below is the traffic flow: Proxy solution and SDWAN solution. The issue is with SDWAN currently:
Trusted network/office:
Client - SDWAN solution - Branch connector devices --- ZIA/ZPA -- Destination.

As this is related to Branch connector, you want someone from Branch connector team to check as we want to determine the public IP is given by Branch connector or the ISP. As discussed, I will move the case to Branch connector team. You also requested for a call with branch connector team tomorrow 6-7 PM IST to check this behavior with user Roman.

Update - 

we are Co-ordinating with local IT Team to resolve this issue . here is the plan 

Step 1 - Disconnect all stack cables and remove switch 1 S/N - FCW2313B3JQ from stack --> Onsite IT
Step 2 - connect USB with IOS file & console cable to Switch 1 S/N - FCW2313B3JQ - --> Onsite IT
Step 3 - Upgrade IOS on Switch 1 S/N - FCW2313B3JQ - 15.2.7E9 ---> LAN Support Engineer
Step 4 - Connect stack cables again - --> Onsite IT
Step 5 - Verify Stack status ---> LAN Support Engineer
Step 6 - Perform upgrade on both switches - 15.2.7E12 ---> LAN Support Engineer

2025-07-03 00:24:42 - <n> (Work notes)
Hi <n> the issues, we have joined a bridge call and started troubleshooting.

1. As we were not able to access the switch, we requested a console and got access to switch 1.
2. After login  switch with local credentials switch came UP and Reachable.
3. We found that Stack was broken, and Stack Switch 2 had a version mismatch.
4. We manually rebooted the switch from the backend, but still the same issues.
5. Switch was trying ""auto-upgrade enable"" for version correction and post that we rebooted. 
6. Post reboot, observed Switch 2 Active and Switch 1 Version mismatch.
7. We try to do force image load from active switch ""archive copy-sw /force-reload /overwrite /dest 2 1"" by both ways but no luck.
8 . We have raised Cisco TAC case: 699335924 for the same.
9. Provided required details to Cisco and the TAC team suggested upgrading OS manually.
10. For the Upgrade version Console is required with a USB.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Comments from cisco:-
The idea is to disconnect sw1 and upgrade as standalone to the IOS version 15.2.7E9. 
After that re connect the stack and upgrade both switches to the golden star version 15.2.7E12  which is the Cisco most stable IOS version for bot switches.

Additionally, here are the steps on how to upgrade the switch:

Step -1 : Copy the IOS to all member switches via TFTP or USB
Step-2: verify MD5 checksum
#verify /md5 flash:<IOS.bin>
Step-3: Setting up boot variable:
#conf t
#no boot system switch all
#boot system switch all flash:<IOS.bin>
#exit
Step-4: Save the changes and check the boot variable
#wr mem
#sh boot
Step-5: Reload the device
#reload

Unstable Wi-Fi and LAN connections — connections are intermittent or ""jumping.""
Even with a cable connection, internet access is unreliable.

The issue began when users started arriving on-site around 8:00 AM CET today. There was no one on-site last week, so the issue may have started earlier but went unnoticed.

The team discussed a network issue affecting connectivity. Akshay Dilip Tawre initiated the call, Djilli, Azzeddine flagged the issue and requested analysis, and Nikhil Dhawale confirmed that the “big one” ISP link was down from 10:30 to 11:20, causing slowness. Monitoring is not yet in place for alerts, but logs will be shared for further review.



Dylan Bouvier and Nikhil Dhawale discussed a network outage that occurred between 10:00 and 11:00. The ISP link was confirmed down during that time and restored at 11:20. Nikhil suggested checking with the ISP for the root cause and noted low traffic usage despite high bandwidth capacity.

The team confirmed that the ISP issue is resolved. Djilli, Azzeddine identified the outage window and emphasized the need for monitoring. Dhawale, Nikhil clarified low utilization during the incident, and Bouvier, Dylan raised concerns about bandwidth expectations. The ticket will be downgraded to P3 and monitored till EOD.

• We have not found any drops and latency from user “<n>” machine.
• To analyse further We are using a test machine to have ping result for next 4 hr approx. to analyse the drops in link if any.
• Parallelly we are getting this checked from link provider (AT&T).
• Also we have asked to check the connections and power on all WAN devices.

MIM Bridge Update:

This is an ongoing network issue, case is also raised with AT&T.
Cosmin confirmed one main link is active, a secondary is pending, and 4G LTE is ready but not configured. 
Two tickets were raised earlier due to slow Internet, especially affecting external traffic.
A more critical issue involves PoE-powered CCTV cameras intermittently dropping offline, suspected to be due to PoE port flapping. 
The Internet issue has persisted for over a month, likely since some changes were implemented, though the site is still on the old setup. 
As currently there's no business impact the team is now treating this as an urgent case (P3), and further troubleshooting is planned using logs from a test machine and support from an on-site technician.

Multiple machines were flagged by  Network Team for high utilization linked to Microsoft IPs. LAN disconnection was recommended for one; Sebastian from EUS confirmed IPs and agreed to proceed post-identification.
Coordination between Gurudas from Network team &  and Sebastian from EUS Team led to isolation of high-usage systems. Manual cancellation of Windows updates was ruled out. Onsite support and update scheduling were discussed.
Piotr from Local onsite investigated a flagged machine, found it inactive, and suspected reporting delays. Network team confirmed it was unreachable and continued tracing IPs.
A server generating high traffic was identified as a distribution point. Abhishek and Yogesh began deeper analysis.
ACCMDP server showed high usage; Yogesh from Windows team confirmed identity and initiated remote checks. Network performance improved post-reconnection.
PLRZDP server was also flagged. Identified traffic was linked to Zscaler; usage was fluctuating but not consistently disruptive. Disconnection was ruled out due to its critical role in OS imaging.
Current bandwidth is stable. No immediate action required. Ticket placed on hold with a checkpoint call scheduled to reassess.

2025-06-10 04:24:53 - Sudam Jadhav, Akash (Additional comments)
Network team confirmed decreased utilization in the last 15 minutes.
Krakow Site: Slight improvement observed, but performance still below expectations.

🛠️ Actions Taken / Planned
Network team is raising a ticket with AT&T to investigate further.

Previous similar issue at Stonehouse was escalated to AT&T.

Caused may be due to Windows 11 Rollout:
Rollout began yesterday but is not mandatory.
Users may be manually triggering downloads via ""Check for Updates.""
Downloads could be occurring via the Internet instead of SCCM, impacting bandwidth.

Some users left laptops powered on overnight, triggering automatic downloads.
Others manually initiated updates in the morning.
Flexera traffic data shows a spike in network usage around 6–7 AM.
🔄 Next Steps
Abhishek Kumar (Desktop engineer Lead) , requested device names to trace update activity via Intune.
If downloads are in progress, they cannot be canceled mid-way.
Downloads are expected to complete in 30–40 minutes, after which network usage should normalize.

Will share further update soon

Hello Divya,
as per now this network instability is not the case when using Excell files (it was especially visible when these files were used), however after my discussion with Mariusz this happened also to my colleague in last week in different day than in my case.

@<n> @<n> 

Indeed, the core of the issue is that we don’t know what exactly is causing the bandwidth spikes — and that’s precisely why we’re reaching out for your assistance. If the root cause was clearly identifiable on our end, we wouldn’t be escalating this further.

Unfortunately, the situation remains unchanged — the issue is still ongoing, and the impact on the environment continues.

We’re hoping your side can help pinpoint any abnormal traffic patterns, service behaviors, or anything out of the ordinary that might explain the intermittent network saturation.

Appreciate your continued support on this.

This week, especially between 07:00 and 09:00 CET, Rzeszow site has recorded unusually high bandwidth usage. This degradation is affecting multiple services and users, not limited to any single system.
We request a thorough analysis of the situation to identify whether any specific devices or services are generating excessive network traffic during these hours.
Additionally, we are organizing a live traffic analysis session tomorrow (<n> 13th) and would appreciate it if someone from network team could join a meeting at 08:30 CET to assist in real-time troubleshooting. We suspect that similar issues are likely to reoccur tomorrow morning.
Please treat this as urgent and contact me directly as soon as possible to coordinate the details of tomorrow’s session.","2025-07-07 08:33:23 - <n> (Work notes)

Thank you! Could you please share the hostnames of the top talkers on the network?
Also, is it possible to identify what exactly these machines are doing – i.e., which processes or services are generating the traffic?

Update - 

- During troubleshooting we have observed 3 sensors were not getting IP addresses from DHCP.
- Tried to remove secondary DHCP helper from layer wireless vlan for testing - still same issue observed
- Tried to configure manual IP address on sensors - still same issue observed
- Re-configured IP reservations - still same issue observed

During Further troubleshooting, We have observed scope replication issue from DHCP side. post manual DHCP scope replication, we have observed sensors getting IP addresses

Additionally Adrian Ieremie helped to create Firewall rules on Datacentres firewall

<n> Nawoj observed all the sensors have received IP addresses and working fine as expected.

Summary:

State of sensors - all are working right now.

Activitites done:

- Diagnosis of sensors, which included: diagnose of issue with DHCP static IP reservation issue, diagnose of issue with firewall rules and exceptions, diagnose issue with connection to NTP servers, diagnosis of connection with sensors cloud server.
- Control activities confirming that sensrs are not damaged in any way.
- Creation appropriate rules and exceptions to firewall which allows ports: UDP: 53, 123 and TCP: 53, 1883, 8883 communication with NTP (real time server synchronization) and sensors cloud server.
- Resolution issue with DHCP static address reservation for sensors.

Activities were taken based on official vendor's guides:

https://testohelp.zendesk.com/hc/nl-be/article_attachments/<PHONE>

and

https://support-testo.fr/documentationOnLine/Saveris_2_2016_logger_errorcode_description_EN_V03.pdf

Mr. Adrian Ieremie and mr. Gurudas Patil please add your notes of your activites.

Update - it seems that after Adrian Ieremie made firewall rules and Patil Gurudas found main issue with DHCP addresation and  sensor reconfiguration by me, sensors are working corretly, however ticket is still open for 1 workday to test if connetion isn't affected on any way.

2025-06-20 01:48:47 - <n> (Work notes)
Update -

I can see , Adrian Ieremie  is helping on this creating firewall rules on Datacenter firewall

We will update ticket today with latest information

2025-06-17 09:48:29 - <n> (Work notes)
Update status:

IT team has followed official vendor's guideline checklist: https://testohelp.zendesk.com/hc/nl-be/article_attachments/<PHONE>
 according to affected sensors.

Required parameters:

Opened ports: 
UDP: 53, 123
TCP: 53, 1883, 8883

Opened communication with ntp.pool.org time servers

Source IP's: 
10.216.20.146 (assigned now by DHCP, another IP's will be included with next ticket updates)

Destinaton IP's: 

18.159.164.226, 
3.120.71.132,
18.158.133.154

those are IP's of cloud server receiving data from sensors.

In actual state it looks like data packets are able to communicate (port 8883)
but communication with NTP servers is blocked (firewall rules are dropping communication).

Current target: enable access to NTP servers for sensors.

⚠ *EXTERNAL SENDER*
Hello <n> you for your time over the phone .

As we discussed, we still need to collect the debug logs from the WLC while the issue is occurring. Please follow the steps below to gather the required information:

1. Access the WLC CLI via SSH or console.
2. Run the following commands using the affected client’s MAC address: “while the issue is happening ”

File 1 :

#config paging disable
#Debug client <client mac address>

File 2 :

#config paging disable
#Show client detail <client mac address> [ try to collect this command multiple times while above debug command running]

Also, can you please confirm what is the SSID name.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Have a great day.


Best <n> AL-Hawawreh

              The other interface should be 1/0/49 ( now the link is placed in Gi 1/0/51 as backup )

              After the port channel is configured and the link from interface Gi 2/0/50 is up and running I will move the second link from current Gi 1/0/51 back to Gi 1/0/49 , ok ?

              Thank you!

              <n>'s establish the real hostname for this switch, that is 10304-RO-SWA08-L2 ( not 10304-RO-SWA23-L2, this is the old one ) I gave you on teams channel the list with all the switches, ip addreses, hostnames.
              I've check with our network tester the fiber and shows an -11 dB power witch is good ; I've replaced both SFP modules ( to switch and core ) and there is still a problem ; I will connect SFP module in another port on switch to check maybe that interface is broken.

Hi team,

I added @<n> Andrei (Iasi), my colleague who is responsible for network.
Andrei checked the fiber and is ok, I understand from him that we need to make again the port channel on fiber.

We will check with production aria and see when is the best time to make port channel and test VLAN's

Thank you!

we swapped switch port from 10304-RO-SWA08-L2 and understood that its cabling issue
for temporary solution we removed switch interfaces from port-channel and vlan 12 is working

Next action - 
Need to involve LAN vendor and check cabling issue between floors
Aside raise case with cisco tac to investigate why vlan 12 is not working on port-channel

Looks both the access points are physically down , we are not able to trace from core switch using mac addresses.

we need help from local onsite IT team to confirm switch hostname & switch port

this device is connected to SWA08 interface Gi 1/0/26 vlan 12 ; on the same table we have another PCthat is connected from SWA056 interface Gi 1/0/26 . We had an issue in weekend with port channel on this switch . One link from port channel was orange ( that means portchannel was not configured well ) we remove that link and the issue was gone. Now we have the same issue. We have the same problem ( random devices connected to SWA03 from vlan 12 does not receive IP address  )

Case Number : 05684293 : Buckingham branch connector down - Site connectivity down
Issue  - Buckingham branch connector primary link traffic routing  issue - Site connectivity on primary link

Impact - This is a production impact 

Summary - 
As discussed, the primary BT link is currently not being preferred by the device due to link scoring showing zero and packet loss indicators, with traffic defaulting onto the LTE fallback link which has lower bandwidth and increased latency. We have confirmed with BT that their circuit appears to be functioning properly and that initial tests on the router show no significant failures or packet loss beyond normal levels. 
Phinia team is working closely with your network team to capture detailed packet-level data on both the LAN and WAN interfaces to further diagnose the cause of the issue. We appreciate the coordinated efforts on site to reseat cables, reboot devices, and conduct direct connectivity tests to isolate the problem.
We acknowledge the delays encountered with device status updates in the Zscaler cloud portal and have escalated the UI responsiveness issue to our backend team to prevent such discrepancies going forward.


Plan of action - 
Looking ahead, we will continue collaboration via scheduled checkpoint calls to review the latest captures and logs. We understand there will be limited on-site support over the weekend, so rest assured our experts will be monitoring progress and guiding remotely. Please feel free to reach out directly to me during this time as needed. A call is scheduled tomorrow for 11am IST for further troubleshooting.

So far below is the summary from checkpoint call-

The Network and Zscaler teams collaborated to resolve issues with the core switch and Zscaler devices. After backing up and rebooting the switch, port GE3 showed intermittent status. One device remained down, and high latency persisted. Console access was unstable, prompting cable adjustments and device reboots. 
Also, Network Team suggested bypassing core switch by connecting BT cable directly to GE3.
Console connected to Zscaler device but no output.
Console cable reconnected to core switch, then back to V device. Zscaler faced connector interface issues, and Kushal from their specialist team joined to assist further.

2025-06-29 01:50:16 - Sudam Jadhav, Akash (Additional comments)
During 1:30 EST checkpoint call, the Network team has recommended checking the console of the core switch. They have ruled out the branch connector as the issue, suggesting the problem may lie between switches. Since the switch was last rebooted three years ago, a reboot is advisable. Before proceeding, it's recommended to take a backup of the switch configuration. Checkpoint call rescheduled to 3 EST (12:30 IST) as someone need to present at location, which may take around hour.

",2025-06-27 10:18:36,2025-06-30 13:57:27,Resolved - Permanent Fix,"Hello ,

There is problem with BT ISP circuit .

BT has changed their IP Address from /28 to /29 address range which caused this outage.

We have reconfigured the IP address in /29 now .

As a workaround we have first configured the ZT400-B device through the LTE connection from Zscaler portal and today we have reconfigured the ZT400-A device from scratch.

The new IP address for the ISP 1 usage as follow

81.134.140.243/29 -  BuckinghamZT400-A -SN  LR202402005303
81.134.140.244/29 - BuckinghamZT400-B - SN LR202402005020

Post configuration the Site is UP and running without any issue.


RCA will be provided by BT ISP vendor , Damon will check with ISP for RCA.

Previously, everything worked fine using the GlobalProtect VPN. It seems that something is blocking the connection, or the Citrix session isn't initializing correctly with the new VPN.

Please assign this to Global Network Team, (SVD  no need to conctact Henri or Me).

Zscaler is breaking the installation of siemens applications.

Please looks to below or attached how zscaler need to be configured to authorize the missing traffic :

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary Domains:
```
*.siemens.com
*.plm.automation.siemens.com
*.sw.siemens.com
download.siemens.com
support.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com
```

Specific Download URLs:
```
https://download.siemens.com/
https://support.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/general/licensing/
https://license.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/
```

License Server Access:
```
https://license.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/lmgrd.exe
https://license.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/intel64/lmgrd.exe
```

For Zscaler configuration to allow XENTPVX installation, you'll need the following settings:

SSL Inspection Bypass:
```
*.siemens.com
*.plm.automation.siemens.com
*.sw.siemens.com
download.siemens.com
support.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com
license.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com
```

Zscaler URL Filtering Policy:
1. Add these domains to the ""Allowed List""
2. Ensure SSL inspection is bypassed for these domains
3. Allow HTTPS (443) traffic for these domains

Specific Zscaler Configuration Steps:

1. Access Zscaler Admin Portal
2. Navigate to Policy > SSL Inspection
3. Add the Siemens domains to the bypass list
4. Under URL Filtering:
   - Add domains to ""Allowed"" category
   - Set policy action to ""Allow""
   - Enable ""Skip SSL Inspection""

Common Issues to Watch For:
- Certificate validation errors
- SSL handshake failures
- Connection timeouts

If you're still experiencing issues after configuring these settings, you might need to:
1. Clear your Zscaler client cache
2. Restart the Zscaler client
3. Verify the changes have propagated through your Zscaler infrastructure

USER'S ISSUE (Detailed issue description):

Wifi - Persistent Wi-Fi Issue on the Blois Site.

Persistent Wi-Fi Issue on the Blois Site

For several months, we have been experiencing a recurring Wi-Fi connection issue on the Blois site. Randomly, some computers display the message ""No internet, secured"" even though they are connected to the Wi-Fi network.

This issue affects at least one person per week, preventing access to external networks (<n>, Outlook, etc.) while maintaining access to the internal network.

The local IT team has attempted various solutions, including:
- The commands /flushdns, /registerdns, /release, /renew, and netsh.
- Updating drivers and BIOS.
- Uninstalling and reinstalling network cards.
Etc

Despite these efforts, the problem persists. Currently, computers BLSLTOFF0341 and BLSLTOFF00024 are affected right now.

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS (record all steps taken):

User contacted SVD for wifi issue at Blois Site.
User mentioned it is a repeated issue.
User said Local IT has performed network troubleshooting.
User said this issue happenes with one or the other person everyday.
Currently, computers BLSLTOFF0341 and BLSLTOFF00024 are affected.
Hence routing this incident to the concerned team.

Hi Ruhika
 
Please describe the issue?
 
I am using Zcaler for VPN connection now
 
there was no problem with it last week
 
but it is not working now
 
 Is there any error message? If so, please share the screenshot.
 
it seems like I am connected
 
but when  I try to open the folders or application, it is not working
 
 
Are you working from Home?
 
yes
 
Zscaler is connected, Right?
 
it seems so
 
you can connect and check if you want
 
we are not so familiar with zscaler
 
Please open zscaler and share me the screenshot 
 
 
It's connected 
 
but why I cannot open any folder or app
 
Are you only unable to access RDP, or anything else as well ?
 
also some SharePoint folders
 
Are you facing this issue after Zscaler rollout?
 
 
I can try with Global Protect
 
but we will stop using it within next week
 
Can you please restart your pc once ?
 
I did it yesterday 
 
should I try again
 
Yes please 
 
it is still the same
 
Please provide me your device name?
 
where is it noted

What is the error message you are getting while accessing sharepoint files?
 
 
Is this shared drive or SharePoint ?

Have you tried to remap the drive?
 
sorry but I have been using these folders since 2 years

There is a specialized team that attends to this issue. I will assign ticket  to the concern team, who would assist you further.

@<n> Hi, Sebastian, good day! there are a few of questions here
1, could you please let me know from where you connects to the VPN? home or office, which office 
2. are those website/url managed by Phinia, those address are overlapped with Phinia internal Azure address, need your confirmation if those urls are public url or Phinia internal url

2025-04-08 04:05:58 - <n> (Work notes)
this is caused by the subnet of vwg, there are 172.19, which maybe overlapped with Phinia internal subnets. I am checking with Zscaler if it's possible to bypass those indival url on branch connector.

Hi Gregory
This is Sweekruti from the global service desk regarding  INC7452457- Issue after workstation restart no more access to network - Need urgent assistance
 
Hi Sweekruti
 
Is it not connecting to both Lan and wifi?
 
I do not have any wifi card in this workstation only LAN is possible
 
ok got it
 
Correct it is not connecting to LAN
 
Can you open command prompt
 
gpupdate /force
 
type above command and hit enter
 
after successful completion try restarting system
 
Now I am back home , as I did not have possibilities to contact anyone using Teams
 
I am no more at the office
 
Oh ok'
 
Can we check tomorrow?
 
Could you do something remotel
 
remotely
 
If I need to take remote there is link that needs to be accessed on that PC
 
I have try to  restart, shutdown , connect another cable but without success
 
There are few commands that needs to performed and checked
 
I will work remotely tomorrow and can not access my workstation physicaly
 
But I need to use it
 
Please is there an other way
 
Ok. Then only option will be local IT need to check
 
Local IT will be onsite so they can check with the system
 
Will that be ok?
 
<n>  Hammanna (External)
Local IT will be onsite so they can check with the system
There is no local IT at Belval office
 
If I ask a colleague to do your  command ""gpupdate /force"" , it would work ?
 
yes it would work
 
Today they can check or tomorrow?
 
Even if he is connecting to my workstation with his credentials?
 
It is network issue right so no issue
 
<n>  Hammanna (External)
Today they can check or tomorrow?
would be tomorrow morning when there will be smebody on site 
 
Do, Gregory (Belval) (External)
would be tomorrow morning when there will be smebody on site
May i know the time
 
Tomorrow I will not be there so I will tell my colleague to contact you and guide what all basic steps can be followed.
 
<n>  Hammanna (External)
It is network issue right so no issue
if it's network issue , why not calling network team and ask to reconnect HPCZ8467M9K to phinia local?
 
But the command which we will be trying are the basic things that need to be tested
 
If you still want to check with network team I can assign to them
 
I am not responsible of this issue , a simple restart and then blackout 
 
Do you think it's normal
 
No it is not as it was a sudden stop of network
 
Do you want me to assign to network team so that they can check?
 
<n>  Hammanna (External)
Do you want me to assign to network team so that they can check?
Could it help ?
 
Ok. Let me assign to network team get update from them and check further
 
Ok thank you.

Hello Manikanta,

Could you please tell me what happened exactly with my workstation yesterday when I restarted it and was no more able to connect to phinia.local?
I have spent hours waiting some support and this morning it works.
Which kind of troubleshooting is possible from my side  , when I face such issue ? Using command prompt with ""gpupdate /force"" would have been sufficient .
Need to know for next time .
Thanks

Ticket needs to be addressed to global network team.

2025-05-22 11:35:16 - Klingenburg, Daniel (Additional comments)
Solution will be:

VW portal needs to be set up with new IPs and name resolution:

the following needs to be linked to VW:

  idp-qa.pfn.cloud.vwgroup.com                           -> IP-Adresse 193.23.108.216
  pki.idp-qa.pfn.cloud.vwgroup.com                   -> IP-Adresse 193.23.108.216

 idp.pfn.cloud.vwgroup.com                                   -> IP-Adresse 193.23.108.215
 pki.idp.pfn.cloud.vwgroup.com                           -> IP-Adresse 193.23.108.215


basically: abc.vwgroup.com DNS to PHINIA internal IP which is mapped to VW internal IP via ENX gateway.

current setup need to be kept:

 
#172.19.16.2                            gateway.ras.audi.vwg
#172.19.16.8                            dox-v.epp.audi.vwg
#172.19.16.9                            portal.epp.audi.vwg
#172.19.16.10                          dox.epp.audi.vwg
#172.19.16.12                          kvs.pfn.vwg
#172.19.16.13                          vwdmsweb.pfn.vwg
#172.19.16.14                          nvs.pfn.vwg

Hi <n> for the update, we need to validate all WAPs and wherever required we need to change the group and reboot. If we reboot all WAP, that will be a good. 


Please confirm to close the incident and please raise an RITM for the below change and reboot WAP.



1. Need to change WLAN profile - From default to 274-GillinghamUK.
2. Reboot WAP.
3. 1hr disturbance will happened in WIFI, as we have 38 WAP and each WAP will take 5 minutes to reboot.
4. We can do changed in working hour, which WAP are not connected with client.

Hi,

No, this has not been resolved. We still need to disable Zscaler to use edm.directevolution platform.

It needs disabling on both Microsoft edge and Chrome.

Hi Gurudas,

If you do the same directly from Internet, not from site, then there is no error at all, so please look further to this and have it resolved.

Also, as previously highlight port 2222 should be opened for https traffic, looks it is not.

I've been asked to close the incident, but I won't, because if I close this incident and raise another one in the future upon experiencing the same issue, it'll be caught in the low priority loop again. To which, if I leave the 'area' of where any new or previous occurrence of the same issue arises again, it won't be resolved, as per this incident INC7496133.

Hello <n> we currently do not have the timeline or expected dates for upgrading the site on SD-WAN and will have other links in place, should we keep the slowness tickets open or proceed with closure? As you are aware, this location has only one link, which often experiences high utilization, making it difficult to limit in the current scenario.

Hello Damon/Cosmin,
 
As discussed in our last call, several tickets are open for the latency issues. 
With only one active link and the migration incomplete, high utilization causes constant spikes. 
We can't keep the tickets on hold until new links are in place. Please approve the closure of these tickets.
 
@<n> (Stonehouse): Could you please confirm if the camera issue has been resolved? I believe it has been resolved.

Hello @<n> A (Stonehouse)

Thanks for sharing more information.

Internet slowness issue is due to High Utilization on MPLS Link.

We are checking internally to identify Top talkers on MPLS link so that we can reduce traffic.

Aside Also checking SDWAN Migration tentative date for this site.

Hi Cosmin,


As checked in the core switch, the reachability seems fine. Please check and confirm the status.

I had call with <n> today for this issue. please find below summary

- We have traced one of the camera devices and identified switch port interface
- Observed switch interface was flapped last on 6th May
- If its PoE issue then we could have see interface down so  its not PoE issue 
- If PoE issue then all camera's uptime could have less , as per disconnection on live camera monitoring
- we concluded that its not issue due to Switch PoE

2025-06-03 06:39:58 - Sasmal, Ashish (Additional comments)
Hi Cosmin,

As we discussed, you are observing that all the cameras (around 100) are going down for 1-5 minutes, and you suspected the POE interface issues. as you know, 100 cameras are not connected to a single switch, and we do not have any scheduled interface down configuration on the switch. As it is an IP Camera, please check the reliability and physical observation.


Please share below for further checking.
1. Check reachability from your system to the camera while down.
2. Check the Physical status of the camera,
3. Share the camera's MAC address with the IP. 
4. You are observing only the camera is down or the WAP also.

As previously stated, this is not a localized incident and ALL the cameras are doing the same, seems like the PoE drops down for 1-5 minutes at same times and the cameras drop connection. This is impacting all CCTV not just the example ones provided, regardless of the switch location onsite, same behavior. All issues started at the same point on the date specified in the initial message.

Hi Cosmin,

   Please check reachability, while the camera is down, as the checked port is fine.

Thanks for the information, as you observed, post-ZCC ""internet security"" enables experiencing slow internet speed. 

As you know, it is not an issue to work now, but we need to understand the variation in speed. We will raise a case with Zscaler for further checking.

On a mobile hotspot, there is a small difference:-
With Zscaler 'Internet Security' enabled: 44Mbps
With Zscaler 'Internet Security' disabled: 54Mbps

On home broadband:-
With Zscaler 'Internet Security' enabled: 170Mbps
With Zscaler 'Internet Security' disabled: 520Mbps

Troubleshooting steps performed: As discussed with @Freestone, Ed, users are facing internet access issue, as per the ipconfig/all details shared in the Team's chat, Philip's device is getting valid IP address and connected to access point, but with no internet. Also, user updated that this issue started when he installed Zscaler a few days ago. We observed that the access points are associating and disassociating from the controller, since this behavior is seen post Branch connector cutover activity, we informed WAN team to check from their end. 
Also, we monitored the access points from 24th March 2025 to 25th March 2025 and are stable.

Update - 

since last week 16th June, we are trying to replicate issue with the help of onsite Local IT
Freestone, Ed  initiated RDP connection from office multiple times since 16th June however not observed issue
On 13th June, I contacted user on Microsoft teams however we have not started packet capture as user was busy
On 16th June I scheduled call with user to start packet capture however user not joined call.
User is out office  since last week and cant see the date of return on work
Took feedback from other users from same location, No one is facing this RDP disconnection issue.


My recommendation - As we are not able to replicate issue , we will proceed with ticket closure and user can re-open or create new ticket in case issue observed again.

We will take closure confirmation from DSSR call and close ticket soon

• RDP connection to 10.166.6.9:3389 disconnects intermittently from both home and office. 
• Multiple users affected, and it seems to be affecting EMEA region only.
• After the disconnection, when connected back it connects back successfully.

As discussed, since the issue is happening from office and home with users on ZCC, the issue maybe on the broker/AppC side and not from the BC side. We will further investigate from ZPA perspective and get back to you with next steps.

Update - 

Intermittent RDP disconnection issue for AZUREUW-DB018.delphidrive.com 10.166.6.9 


1. issue is for multiple users working from office & working from home
2. taking follow-up with Zscaler Team and asked if we can have troubleshooting call without user
3. Agreed to involved local IT engineer who has access to destination server if user is really required on call during troubleshooting
4. Aside we are involving Wintel/Server team to check to perform health check on destination server

Next Action - 
1. Work with Zscaler team and ask to involve Brach & ZIA Team as this issue is observed when working from office as well as working from home.
2. Involve Server/Wintel team who manages destination server to perform health check

Hi Jon,

2025-04-30 22:30:34 - <n> (Work notes)
Hi Jon,

      As you already mentioned, you are getting frequently disconnected, so there is no block rule for this, and we need to check the network stability for your network.  Even server-side also needs to check, we are checking this with the server team. also verify the 10.166.6.9 connectivity is fine.

1. Issue observed in the PHINIA network or the Open internet.
2. Destination - AZUREUW-DB018 / 10.166.6.9
3. source - Device IP, User Name.

Hi, Damon, good day! @<n>
      Could you please help to do a ping test when you are facing the intermittent disconnecting issue? or you can run this script in Power Shell when you start to work to monitor the connectivity status in a txt file

@<n> Hi Fan, as discussed over Teams, the users can access the server via RDP, that is not the issue.  The issue experienced is repeated disconnections, no pattern.  Completely random.

2025-04-02 02:01:22 - <n> (Work notes)
the rdp works on FQDN, not only the hostname, please try again with azureuw-db018.delphidrive.com

Priority increased to P3, users unable to work onsite, remote only.

2025-03-25 12:30:18 - <n> (Work notes)
Since the policy change on Zscaler whereby users onsite are no longer tunnelled (connected on zscaler but now disabled) the site is no longer available.  The site is accessible from other PHINIA locations that are not cutover.  Must be a DNS routing issue

- 3+ days without resolution
- Assigned to Borman Bravo in Global Network Services but minimal progress
- Only one minute of documented work on ticket despite business escalations
- Multiple business stakeholders escalating via email (Export Manager, Logistics Manager)
- P3 SLA for response time (30 minutes) breached by over 5,498%
- No proactive updates provided to affected users

PRIORITY ELEVATION JUSTIFICATION:
- Business leadership (Richard Travers, Logistics Manager) has explicitly stated P3 is unacceptable
- This is a key shipping function critical for export operations during end of quarter
- While a workaround exists (remote work), it's operationally inefficient
- Per Travers: ""without access to this site we cannot ship to our export customers""
- Issue impacting business continuity for export operations


REQUIRED:
1. Recommend immediate elevation to P2
2. Schedule bridge ASAP  today whether P3 or P2
3. Regular status updates (minimum every 4 hours) until resolution
4. Escalation if not resolved within 24 hours

Since Zscaler was installed last week, I can no longer access our global label system ""Nice Label"" to perform my daily role. This worked perfectly before Zscaler.

Troubleshooting steps performed: We asked user to share ipconfig/all details for the problematic device, from those devices we found that the device received valid IP address and connected to PHINIA SSID.
On Hold Reason (If applicable): NA
Latest Update: Lockley, Martin updated in chat that there was no access to PHINIA internet across the site earlier. So, Damon asked Freestone, Ed to take a look at the issue. He reached the site and users asked about the Zscaler auto install pop up, so he informed them to install, the Wi-Fi was working fine after they installed it, and user confirmed to close the ticket over mail only (I have attached the confirmation mail to this ticket).

The expected behaviour when connected to Zscaler is that all ping, nslookup etc commands will return the IP address of 100.64.*.* this is part of the zero trust setup.  As Stonehouse is not cutover you will be able to connect to any machine still using the IP or FQDN of the device, this will not be affected.

Hello Madhan
 
May I know your availablity to check with this issue?
 
May I have the error screenshot please?
 
I'm available right now and it's really critical. We are 5 collagues trying to connect remote pcs. Some of us can connect some of us can not.
 
We also have contacted with local IT. He is also trying from the office right now in parallel. We are working remote right now.
 
Ok, May I have the error screenshot please?

Right now I'm trying to connect with Zscaler VPN.
 
 
 
I try with both IP and PC name
 
Are you connected to Zscaler vpn?
 
yes
 
Have you rebooted your computer?
 
Yes I have rebooted the remote pc and my own pc a couple of times.
 
I will send this ticket to the Global Network services team to check and assist you further.
 
Skywalker: I can connect Skywalker when someone opens the computer. And after a few minutes, if no one is connected to the remote PC, I think it goes to sleep. And it asks for the Bit-Locker password from time to time. After restarting the computer, it doesn't ask again.
 
Pioneer & Aurobay-Lion : I haven't been able to connect to this PC yet. When I try to connect to the PC, it says ""An internal error has occurred"".

This is Madhan contacting from global service desk
 
May I know your availability to check with this issue?
 
Arge, are we connected?
 
Arge, awaiting your response are we still connected?
 
Arge, are we connected?
 
Hello
 
Yes
 
May I know the exact issue that you are facing?
 
Sure, I will explain in a few minutes if you allow me
 
I am working on something
 
Sure
 
So , we can not connect to the QAC server via Zscaler VPN. We used to run QAC test server with izmltoff00059 and izmltoff1223 ports before, but now it is not available because we can't connect with PC name. 
 
We are usually working with remote connection, but due to the Zscaler VPN, QAC server connection is failed
 
Ok, May I have the error screenshot please?
 
Yes,sure
 
We can't access remote desktops by name. To get the IP, we need to access a PC in the office and look from there. When we reported it to IT, they said it would work if we added .phinia.local, but it doesn't work.
As a continuation of this error, we cannot access the QAC servers. This is a blocking point for our work.
Even if we try to connect with IP, the test list area (grey area) at the bottom remains empty. The tool is not suitable for such a use anyway, there is a server name check in all scripts and bat files. Connecting with IP requires major changes in the tool, including the executables on the users' computers.
 
Alright, I will send this ticket to the Global Network services team to check on this.
 
Ok, thanks so much.

Troubleshooting steps performed:
1. As per the ipconfig/all details (attached here for reference) shared over team’s chat, the device received valid IP address, but DNS servers are not seen.
2. So, I informed user to run ipconfig/flushdns command and post that your device got connected to WAP072 but with no internet access.
3. Also, user informed that none of the users are able to access internet when they are connected to PHINIA SSID near WAP072.
4. And able to access internet when devices connected to TEST SSID-SDWAN SSID near same WAP.
5. We verified the WAP connected port configuration, status, speed, cable test and settings in the controller, everything seems to be fine.
6. So, we asked user to restart the device, post that issue still persist.
7. We did port bounce, post that user's device is connected to WAP072 and able to access internet.
On Hold Reason (If applicable): NA
Latest Update: Post WAP connected port bounce, user's device is connected to WAP072 and able to access internet. Today morning users haven’t seen any issues with internet access. Hence, we are closing the ticket with your confirmation.

USER'S ISSUE (Detailed issue description):
Hello,

after implementing Zscaler, the Demand Planning Teams located in Poland, UK and Turkey cannot use Filezilla to contact SO99 sftp servers. 
We have to use sftp servers to upload files to SO99 servers and download from the same locations. 
When GlobalProtects was in use, we shared the fixed IP addresses for PL and UK gateways to SO99 provider and those addresses were whitelisted so we coul connect to sftp servers when user was connected to VPN.

Please advise how we can configure connection using Zscaler as GlobalProtect will be disabled in early days of April. This functionality is critical for us, without it we will not be able to exchange files with SO99 app (external).

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS (record all steps taken):
User contacted service desk regarding No access to sftp servers through Filezilla.

Hello <n> day!

We just finished troubleshooting call along with @<n> (Warwick) @<n> (Warwick) & Zscaler Team. Please find below update.

SFPT access when working from home
• Jason helped us to initiate traffic, and we can see allowed logs on Zscaler, so we need to engage Vendor and check real time logs from their end.
• SFTP access was not working even if we disabled Zscaler Client so that is strange.

SFTP access working from office [20032 - Warsaw – Poland]
• Moreton Keey helped us to initiate traffic for SFTP
• We need to do few changes on Zscaler end to allow traffic for SFTP
• Again, we need to engage Vendor who manages SFTP on destination to allow to check traffic on their end once we allow access on Zscaler side.

Please help us to schedule meeting with SFTP vendor Network team to discuss further [I will engage Zscaler team as per schedule] meanwhile We are working for Zscaler End change.

Thanks @<n> (Warwick) @<n> (Warwick) for sharing more information on issue.

Thanks!

Subject: Case Number : 05654087 : No access to sftp servers through Filezilla INC7445718 [ thread::HwziTvQ0d3O13nxxUtlvIFs:: ]

 ⚠  *EXTERNAL SENDER* 
Hello <n> you for your time during the meeting, it was nice talking to you.
Below is the summary of our call:
Issue: Upon migrating traffic to Zscaler cloud, users are unable to access the SFTP server.
• During our meeting, we observed that the connection to the SFTP server fails with a connection timeout.
• Upon further investigation, we found that the user location is disabled in the Firewall module, causing port 22 traffic to be blocked.
• We tested SFTP server access with a user working from home and observed the connection again failing with a timeout error; however, for this user, we found logs in Firewall Insights indicating that traffic is allowed.
• We disabled ZIA on the user's machine to check SFTP server access from the open internet, but the connection still failed with a timeout error.
• Based on these tests, we suspect an issue with the SFTP server.
Next Action Plan:
1. Please confirm if the SFTP server is using Active mode or Passive mode. Only Passive mode works with Zscaler. https://help.zscaler.com/zia/about-ftp-control
2. Ensure access to the SFTP server works on the open internet.
3. Test if the connection to the SFTP server works when the user is connected to home Wi-Fi or a mobile hotspot.
4. Once the user is part of the configured location (Warwick), make sure the Firewall module is enabled for that location to allow port 22 traffic.
5. A policy is already in place to allow the traffic under rule number 8, so further configuration is not required.
Thank you!

I contacted the SO99 team, here is the information from them: Do you know whether Zscaler has a particular range of IP addresses being used? We can maybe try whitelisting the range. Our standard approach is sFTP to connect to the server. I can discuss internally and see if we can collect files from you? This would be chargeable as it's not our standard setup so there will be a change request. If we can narrow down the range of IPs required by Zscaler, it would be helpful in setting up new whitelist that is not overly broad.

Hello @PhiniaGlobalNetwork@phinia.com/@bobravo@phinia.com,

Could you please check on the below request and do the needful ASAP? Kindly look on this issue on priority, we have database backups and those are failing.

Backups are failing again.  Port: 5565 should be allowed both direction in between source and target clients. Kindly open port between source and target.

Source : Backup server
castba01.delphidrive.com 10.34.9.5
 
Target Clients:
trizmp-bu01.delphidrive.com 10.236.120.31
trizm-ap06.delphidrive.com 10.142.34.21
trizda01.delphidrive.com 130.171.227.13
trizmp-ap12.delphidrive.com 10.142.34.20
 

We raised case with vendor and tested below operation. Vendor identified that, there is a issue with network changes. PFA. 
Vendor tried to reproduce the issue with VBDA.exe binary in DA(Disk agent- Backup agent) client end, it is failed with connection error.

USER'S ISSUE (Detailed issue description):

Phinia wifi issue - Laptop will not connect to the phinia wifi but connects to LAN and Guest wifi.

When connecting to Phinia wi-fi is fails to connect to the internet. It is able to obtain an IP address but will not connect to emails, Teams or Edge. The laptop connects via wired connection. I have released and renewed the IP address and was able to ping the DNS servers and DHCP on wifi. When on wired connection, company portal has error ""This device is already setup in another organisation"". This appears to be the reason the laptop is not working on Phinia Wi-Fi. 
If you need any further assist please contact me Tim Peel on-site engineer

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS (record all steps taken):

Contacted local IT on teams.
Local IT said the laptop won't connect to the internet via Phinia wifi. It works with wired or guest wifi. 
Local It also mentioned that they suspect that the issue is that the Company portal is not working and is stopping the laptop from connecting via the Phinia Wi-Fi

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS (record all steps taken):
David Lord was unable to access the files.phinia.local FTP server using WinSCP while working from home when connected to the network with the ZScaler client.  
This is required as he needs to process files from DHL that are uploaded to the files.phinia.local FTP server.   Could the networking team take a look at this please, and ensure that access to files.phinia.local is not blocked when the ZScaler client is in use?

Hi Emre,

As discussed over team's chat, We had bounced the WAP55 connected port Gi2/0/45 after that users are able to connect the wireless network. We had verified MAC address which you had shared in the team's chat we can see that device is able to connect to the network as well.

[cid:501d3e73-1ae9-4f54-adf1-db7da42ff84f]

As you updated in the team's chat, users are able to connect to the wireless network and LAN without any issues as of now. Please check the remaining PC's connection as well and update us. Hence, we are placing the ticket on hold.

Thanks & regards,

Hi Michael,

As discussed, the device with MAC address 28:C5:D2:24:0C:84 unable to connect the new-man ID. And the device type is intel-corporate as per standards, new-manid is only for scanners & wireless printers, you can use PHINIA SSID for laptop. But you need new-manid for the company restaurant. The device is able to connect the new man id when it was nearer to WAP087 but unable to connect to the new man id when it was in WAP260. As you updated tomorrow morning, you will try to connect the device when you nearer to WAP260. Hence, we are placing the ticket on hold.

Hi Team,

Please find the summary below,

1. There was a power outage activity at site - 20030, post activity we performed health checks for all the LAN devices (switches & access points), all the switches were accessible remotely and access points are up, associated to the controller, except one WAP - 20030-RZENwAP-MorseM-23. 
2. Earlier this WAP was connected to switch - 20030-RZENwSw-MorseM-09 to port - Gi3/0/20. But local IT () informed that the WAP is connected to different port, so I have configured that port, so post that WAP was up. 
3. But Narendar from DXC Wintel team informed that the below devices are not up, so he asked us to check the reachability.
VMware devices:
PLRZEP-ESX01 :- 10.216.43.25 :- ILO IP
PLRZEP-ESX02 :- 10.216.43.26 :- ILO IP
PLRZEP-ESX03 :- 10.216.43.27 :- ILO IP
PLRZEP-ESX04 :- 10.216.43.28 :- ILO IP
Backup device:
 PPDM :- 10.216.43.29
4. We checked & the IP addresses are not reachable, but local IT has informed that all the VxRail devices are up.

5. Narendar also informed that there are three Dell switches at site, but we don't have access to them. As per Adrian's request we have just configured the ports on Site's cisco core switch (attached the mail), and we haven't configured the Dell switches, also don't have access or unable to ping the Dell switch IP addresses.

7. Site was facing internet issues, post restarting the devices were able to connect to PHINIA SSID.
8. Since we haven't configured the Dell switches, and we don't have access/unable to reach the Dell switch, Adrian or Dell team need to support further.

As per the discussion Bartoz and Rafl

VxRail devices are up and running fine.
But the devices which are connected to VxRail switch., Problem with Dell Switch to Cisco Switch which are connected having the problem.

Thanks

Troubleshooting steps performed: We need onsite support to isolate and identify the issue. Therefore, I kindly request you to align someone to assist with the testing.
 
Next Steps (POA):
 
1. Since the issue is occurring in wired VLAN 1, we will configure the switch port in another wired VLAN (350) with the help of the onsite user, collect the necessary captures, and conduct testing in VLAN 1 as well.
2. All access (2960X)model and core (N9K-C9504) switches are currently running outdated versions. To prevent potential issues, we are planning to upgrade all switches to the latest version. for this, we require downtime approval to proceed with the activity.

Hello,

This has been worked upon but do not know why no updates were registered. Network issues are mostly resolved, autopilot is now working , PXE is now working mostly by using an external network card attached to the device. The DXC SCCM team is also working to check on the problem.

Hi Bartosz,

As discussed in the call, earlier WAP - 20030-RZENwAP-MorseM-23 was connected to the switch - 20030-RZENwSw-MorseM-09 on port - Gi3/0/20, but you have removed it and connected to the same switch on a different port - Gi3/0/1 (which we are not aware until you informed me in the call). So I configured the port - Gi3/0/1, post which the WAP was up, associated to the controller.

[cid:image001.png@01DB859D.015C7DC0]

Since there is an issue with VMs/VxRail devices, you connected the WAP to the previous port - Gi3/0/20.

20030-RZENwSw-MorseM-09#sh int Gig 3/0/20
GigabitEthernet3/0/20 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
  Hardware is Gigabit Ethernet, address is b44c.90a2.6e94 (bia b44c.90a2.6e94)
  Description: AP23

Note: Please notify us whenever you remove any access point and connect to a different switchport, so that we will configure the port accordingly.

Troubleshooting steps performed: We checked reachability of WAP's IP address and verified in the wireless controller.
On Hold Reason (If applicable): NA
Latest Update: There is a Power Outage activity - CHG0527174 going on, performed health checks for all the LAN devices (switches & access points), we are able to access all the switches remotely and all the access points are up, associated to the controller, except the below mentioned WAP and the change ends at 09:30PM IST. Hence, site SDM informed local IT to check.
Next update (Date): NA

Switches are up and have been up for weeks - you need to ensure you have Ip reachability from your source and bidirectional routing operational before assuming these devices are down


10657-RO-SWC01-L3 uptime is 5 weeks

Troubleshooting steps performed: We checked reachability and accessibility of all the switches remotely.
On hold reason: We are still unable to access the switches remotely and waiting for the update from local IT/WAN team, since WAN team implemented all the switches to SDWAN.
Latest update: Jonathan updated that all the switches are up, Bucharest migrated to the new SDWAN on Jan 16th, 2025, and he asked WAN team to check the tooling connectivity.

Hi Vineetha,

I apologize. The switch is operating behind our servers, and if it stops, the entire production line will come to a halt.
Therefore, any action you take will be highly risky.

Hi Vineetha,

Great! Now that it's online, please verify which ports it is connected to on the core and edge switches.
Additionally, could you send me the MAC addresses associated with this device?

This will make it easier for us to locate the device.

Hi Manikanta,

I have a lot of ongoing tasks right now, and there is a note stating that this switch is in the electrical room, but we couldn't find such a switch there.
I don't have time to go through both factories one by one at the moment.
If you want to assist, please check which port it is connected to on the Core Switch and if it leads to an edge switch, let us know.

Hi Herve,

Now the WAP connected cable diagnostics looks normal. Incase if issue re-occurs again you need to replace the cable instead of disconnect and reconnect it.

The problem is with the cable, I had to disconnect it and reconnect it.
I'll leave it for tonight. There's an intervention planned in this bay this afternoon, there might still be the problem (but I hope not).

Hello Christian,

   As per WAN team there is mis configuration in the BC. So, he has corrected it and done some changes in the WAP's configuration. Then the WAP's are associated in the US WLC and they are stable. We could see clients also able to connect to WAP's now.

To switch - 10605-DE-SWC00-L3 in port - Gi1/0/46 a WAP - 10605-DE-WAP002 is connected and the MAC addresses (64:49:7d:cf:c4:8e, 96:cf:58:6f:c7:ee & f0:20:ff:e4:64:bb) are user's device MAC addresses which are connected to that access point.

Also for this site SDWAN cutover is already completed, we are receiving WAPs down-up alerts frequently, so we observed that the WAPs are associating and disassociating between Amsterdam controller and Miami controller. This was seen for other sites too, for which cutover was completed.

@PhiniaGlobalNetwork<mailto:PhiniaGlobalNetwork@phinia.com> team please check and let us know what steps needs to followed further.

Hello Manikanta,

Can you please clarify as to what device (f020.ffe4.64bb) it is connected at the port Gi1/0/46 ?
Just by coincidence we have our external IT person Ulrich at site today visiting for some other reason. I have advised him to inspect and remove this device from port.
Will confirm once done.

Hi to all,

As you know we do not have IT onsite in Düsseldorf! How can this be checked ""easily"" for a business user onsite?

@Linne, Rosanna (Duesseldorf)<mailto:rlinne@phinia.com>: do you know what the impact is at Düsseldorf office currently?

Best regards,

Hello <n> we currently do not have the timeline or expected dates for upgrading the site on SD-WAN and will have other links in place, should we keep the slowness tickets open or proceed with closure? As you are aware, this location has only one link, which often experiences high utilization, making it difficult to limit in the current scenario.
 
Please advise.

Hello Damon/Cosmin,
 
As discussed in our last call, several tickets are open for the latency issues. 
With only one active link and the migration incomplete, high utilization causes constant spikes. 
We can't keep the tickets on hold until new links are in place. Please approve the closure of these tickets.
 
@<n> (Stonehouse): Could you please confirm if the camera issue has been resolved? I believe it has been resolved.

Hello @<n> A (Stonehouse)

Thanks for sharing more information.

Internet slowness issue is due to High Utilization on MPLS Link.

We are checking internally to identify Top talkers on MPLS link so that we can reduce traffic.

Aside Also checking SDWAN Migration tentative date for this site.


Thanks!

Hello Damon, 

I have observed that ISP Uplink A appears to be active, however, the utilization traffic is not being displayed on Cacti.

@<n> (Bucharest) : Could you kindly assist me in understanding the flow on the Primary ISP? 
Although I can see the traffic on the interface, it is not being reflected in the Cacti tool.

Hello <n> we currently do not have the timeline or expected dates for upgrading the site on SD-WAN and will have other links in place, should we keep the slowness tickets open or proceed with closure? As you are aware, this location has only one link, which often experiences high utilization, making it difficult to limit in the current scenario.
 
Please advise.

Hello Damon/Cosmin,
 
As discussed in our last call, several tickets are open for the latency issues. 
With only one active link and the migration incomplete, high utilization causes constant spikes. 
We can't keep the tickets on hold until new links are in place. Please approve the closure of these tickets.
 
@<n> (Stonehouse): Could you please confirm if the camera issue has been resolved? I believe it has been resolved.

Hello @<n> A (Stonehouse)

Thanks for sharing more information.

Internet slowness issue is due to High Utilization on MPLS Link.

We are checking internally to identify Top talkers on MPLS link so that we can reduce traffic.

Aside Also checking SDWAN Migration tentative date for this site.


Thanks!

Some UK websites are working again but most still detect the user’s location as being USA and so won’t allow quotations etc in GBP.

Dell have reported that the support issues are resolved thank you Adrian and Adrian.

General performance is still awful at times, and we regularly see timeouts even with the internal Phinia resources.

Hello,

A staff member has replied to your question:
Good afternoon,

I hope you are well.
We have been made aware that DXC have raised a second high severity incident tickets for the Gillingham site. 

Please note, from an iomart perspective, currently we are waiting for Phinia to resolve the routing issues. 

Sri and Borman, until the routing issue has been rectified, iomart can't further progress this request. 
Kind regards,
